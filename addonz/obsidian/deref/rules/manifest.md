# Manifest rules (`manifest.json`)

- Must include (non-exhaustive):
    - `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)
    - `name`
    - `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)
    - `minAppVersion`
    - `description`
    - `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)
    - Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
- Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
- Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
- Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml
